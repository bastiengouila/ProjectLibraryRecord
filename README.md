# ProjectLibraryRecord
This is a C++ project made at Helsinki, Metropolia University of Applied Sciences for the Object Oriented C++ for Smart Systems 

The purpose of this project is to use several object oriented features of C++ language to realize a Library Record.

The following commands are available: 

-NEW BOOK Register a new book 
-RENEW Renew your borrowing 
-BORROW Borrow a book 
-RETURN Return a book that you borrowed 
-SAVE Save the Library Record in an xml file 
-LOAD Load the Library Record from an xml file 
-LIST Display the book list by ID number 
-CLEAR Clear all book form the record 
-STOP Go out of the proram 
-DEBUG Stop the program and display if they are memory leaks 
-HELP Display the commands and their actions

The C++ features used during this project are: 

C++ classes and normal and dynamic objects, containers, operators and functions overloading, input and output streams, memory leaks detection. 

Because of the fact that the program is made in C++ 11, the dynamic object and the memory management can also been handle with the new features like auto pointers or unique pointers.
